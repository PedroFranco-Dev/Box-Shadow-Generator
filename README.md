# Box Shadow Generator

This project is a **box-shadow** generator that allows users to create custom shadows for HTML elements. With intuitive controls, users can adjust various parameters, preview the result in real-time, and copy the generated CSS code.

## Features

- **Horizontal Shadow Adjustment**: Control the horizontal offset of the shadow.
- **Vertical Shadow Adjustment**: Control the vertical offset of the shadow.
- **Blur Control**: Adjust the shadow's blur intensity.
- **Spread Control**: Modify the shadow's spread.
- **Color Selection**: Choose the shadow's color using a color picker.
- **Opacity Control**: Set the shadow's opacity.
- **Inset Shadow**: Enable or disable the inner shadow (inset).
- **Real-time Preview**: Instantly see the changes applied to the preview box.
- **CSS Style Copying**: Copy the generated CSS code with one click.

## Code

The project is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main logic resides in the BoxShadowGenerator class, which handles the control values and applies the shadow rules to the preview element.
